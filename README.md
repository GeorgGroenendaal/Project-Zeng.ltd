# Project Zeng.
Project Zeng is a school project for the second year Q1 of the Software Engineering/Security Engineering course of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences.

The goal of this project is to design an solar screen control unit for a fictional company Zeng ðŸ˜Ž.

The project consist of two parts, an dashboard written in Python 3.5x used to control and modify the control units running on Arduino Uno's written in C.

## Python Functionality
This branch is all about the the code that connects the Arduino & C part with the GUI. The De- and encode algorithms can be found here.
