# Project Zeng.
Project Zeng is a school project for the second year Q1 of the Software Engineering/Security Engineering course of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences.

The goal of this project is to design an solar screen control unit for a fictional company Zeng ðŸ˜Ž.

The project consist of two parts, an dashboard written in Python 3.5x used to control and modify the control units running on Arduino Uno's written in C.

## C
The latest build can be found under *C > build* and can be flashed to an Arduino Uno using avrdude.

To build the program you can use the avr-gcc toolchain.
An example (linux) build process would be.

    # Cd to src/
    # Compile using gcc
    avr-gcc -Os -mmcu=atmega328p main.c -o ../build/build.o
    # Convert to hex
    avr-objcopy -O ihex ../build/build.o ../build.hex
    # Flash to Arduino using avrdude
    avrdude -c arduino -P /dev/ttyACM0 -p m328p -U flash:w:../build/build.hex

## Dashboard
The settings for the control units can be modified using our dashboard. The dashboard uses an Graphical User Interface made with the PyQT module. Enter the following command to install pyQT5 and all its dependencies:

    # python3 -m pip install pyqt5

This will install the wheel for your platform and your version of Python (assuming both are supported). The wheel will be automatically downloaded from the Python Package Index. After that just run Dashboard.py (with Python 3.x!) to open the dashboard.
